Diagnostic tests may be requested if necessary, and\r\n              referrals to other doctors might be suggested. The doctor should\r\n              provide a possible diagnosis, explain the plan of management,\r\n              including the benefits and risks of treatment options, and ensure\r\n              appropriate follow-up.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Should you be prescribed medication, kindly notify the doctor of\r\n              any allergies and disclose your current medications.

The clinician\r\n              will make reasonable efforts to start the consultation within 15\r\n              minutes of your scheduled appointment time. On occasion, the\r\n              clinician might be able to commence your consultation earlier and\r\n              will contact you by phone to confirm if it&apos;s convenient. If\r\n              not, the consultation will proceed as planned. Similarly, there\r\n              might be instances when the clinician is delayed due to urgent\r\n              needs of another patient. Please be patient, and we will keep you\r\n              informed, prioritising care at the point of need.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The clinician will make at least three attempts to contact you\r\n              within the appointment window before concluding the case and\r\n              moving on to the next patient. During your consultation, ensure\r\n              you&apos;re in a private location and can give the doctor your\r\n              undivided attention. Avoid activities like driving, using\r\n              machinery, or anything that could compromise safety, yours or\r\n              others&apos;. The clinician may terminate the consultation if\r\n              there&apos;s a perceived risk.
